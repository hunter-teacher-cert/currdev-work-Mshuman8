* **Assignment 2:** Sliders && Space

* * This lesson has students demonstrating their master of sliders, variables and space. Students must create variables that will control various aspects of their canvas art. They must create sliders on their canvas that allow the user to manipulate the elements on their canvas to control the positive and negative space of the work of art.
  * **Student Instructions: Task:**  Create a program using sliders that plays around with the Element of Art: SPACE. You must include at least three sliders and you must have each slider control different variables of your canvas.
