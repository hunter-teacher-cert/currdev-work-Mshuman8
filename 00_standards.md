* Pick 2 specific NY CS standards and describe a lesson/task/assignment that addresses your selected standards, explain how.

* You can use the same lesson/task/assignment for both, or different ones.

9-12.CT.9: Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10: Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

* Lesson: Studets work in a group to create a calculator project. Students need to come up with an idea that will include mathematical computations, functions, and conditionals. Students need to run their program and test to ensure that the program will work regardless of what the user types in (did they type what they were supposed to? Did they put a letter instead of a number? Can it work for any operation the user selects? etc.) Students must work together to write out a minimum of a paragraph explaining how their program works and how it can be used.
