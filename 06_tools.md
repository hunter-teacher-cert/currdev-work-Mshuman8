# Technological Tools

## Tool #1: p5 Editor

The p5 Editor is the IDE that I use in my Software Engineering 2, Software Engineering 3 and AP CSP course (all are taught mainly in p5). This IDE was made specifically for p5.js which means the error handling is really gret for first time coders. 

This is the editor that my students use for ALL of their projects -- we use it in code alongs, independent projects, group work and projects. I selected this editor mainly because the person who taught Software Engineering 2 before me used it and I happened in to it. I also ended up staying with it though because I have found that the error handling really is superb and enables my students to have a better understanding of what is happening in comparison to another editor such as replit.

## Tool #2: Padlet

I use Padlet occasionally in my Software Engineering 2, Software Engineering 3 and AP CSP courses. I generally do this when I want students to have an opportunity to see their peer's work without having to get up (a gallery walk of sorts). I really enjoy Padlet's ability to leave comments because that is something I prioritize in my classroom. I selected this tool because it was recommended to me by a fellow art teacher (she also uses it for digital gallery walks). 

I will say that I know in previous years there was some dilemmas about whether their privacy policy should allow its use in classrooms.
