* **Course**: Game Development && Art Design (HS, students have taken at least two years of computer science but some have taken 3.)
* **Language 1 Choice**: Scratch
* * **Writing/Running**: This is a block based language and is run within the web editor. I think my students would have no difficulty with this. If there was any difficulty it would be because they are used to writing their own lines of code instead of picking blocks.
  * **Complexity**: I would say this has a very low level of complexity in terms of the syntax
  * **Strengths**: I think students could potentially make very strong games using Scratch becasue it would enable them to focus on the elements of design and would not be held back by aspects of code they do not know.
  * **Weaknesses**: I think a significant weakness is that this would seem like a step backwards for most of them since they have spent 2-3 years in text based langauges. I think they would view scratch as juvenile and would not engage.
    
* **Language 2 Choice**: Processing (specifically with Java or JavaScript)
* * **Writing/Running**: This is a text based language and would be done in an editor either on the web or remotely. I would most likely use a web editor to simplify the fact that my computers are used among all of my classes and I don't necessarily want students working remotely and getting their work confused with others.
  * **Complexity**: I think that this language is very accessable, especially if done with JavaScript. I would rate it low on the complexity scale while still feeling like there were challenges.
  * **Strengths**: I love that this is text based and the students would have to write all of their own code. I also love the documentation that is provided by the Processing Foudnation -- I think it is extremely easy to read and would enable students to get in a better habit of teaching themselves new concepts. Additionally, I love that this links coding with a creative space and would pull in more artistic students. Finally, I like that this enables me to still teach higher level concepts such as Classes and OOP but within a fun way.
  * **Weaknesses**: I think that students who struggle could latch on to the aspects of Processing that are not logical -- such as a student could technically make an entire project usign just shapes and very little computational thinking. I think this would become very evident though if a teacher was supporting all students.
