New Course: Software Engineering 3: Game Development

Description: In this course, students will build on their low level understanding of object oriented programming to make games using p5.js. Students will start the year with refresher lessons on the foundational concepts of CS (selection, iteration, etc) and then will spend a unit diving deep into Object Oriented programming. Students will have scaffolded projects throughout the first 2/3rds of the course and then will spend the last third of the course designing and creating a game of their own. 

Target Audience and Trajectory: Ideally I would like this course to be the capstone at my school. So students would enter and start in 9th grade and take our Software Engineering 1 course (Web Development and Python), followed by Software Engineering 2 (p5.js) in 10th grade, followed by APCSP in 11th and then this course in their senior year. 

Unfortunately, since I teach at a small school it is very likely that my desired trajectory is not smething that is actually going to happen. I am attempting to have this course this year (though I have yet to really write the curriculum, that is what I am doing over the next two weeks) and already there are students who are taking the course after taking APCSP and some students who are taking it before APCSP. This is definitely going to make it extremely difficult to have cohesive lessons for the whole group but I do understand that programatically we cannot have a course for just 8 students.
