## Assignment:
* filename: **01_compare.md**
* Compare the curriculum for a CS class you currently/will/have recently taught with a pre-packaged curriculum for the same course (or a course with similar focus).
  * If you teach CSA or CSP, you could use a different version of that course.
  * For other courses, look around for pre-packaged courses with similar aims. Many of the Curriculum providers we looked at for AP CSP also provide intro courses at the least.
* Focus on the following:
  * Major differences
  * Major similiarities
  * Comparative streangths & weaknesses (That is does one cover a topic paticularly better/worse over the other. If both seem euqlly good then no need to comment).
  * Would you adopt anything from the curriculum you do not teach into your class if you could? Why?


* Two Curricula: My own AP CSP Curriculum that I made with a coworker and Code.org AP CSP curriculum.

* Similarities: Both of our curricula identify that it is best if you split the year between coding and not coding. We both emphasize the three foundational concepts of code -- sequencing, selection and iteration.
  
* Differences: Code.org's curriculum starts the year off with the non coding topics (The Internet, Cybersecurity, etc) while I end my year with it. I have found that the majority of my students are excited to join AP CSP because they truly love coding. I want to get them started with that right away because it enables them to get hooked and buy into the class. I then cover teh non coding topics after the Create Task work time. Additionally, I think there are some aspects of the non coding based topics that leans more towards memorization and therefore it is better if that is as close to the AP test as possible (for example Binary > Decimal, etc).

* Strengths/Weaknesses: I personally do not believe that APCSP should be taught using block based coding. I think that if a student is getting college credit then they should be pushed to learn a text based language. The Code.org curriculum uses a text based language, my curriculum uses JavaScript.

* Future adaptations: I have thought about using some of Code.org's lessons that are not coding based (networks, routers, HTTP/DNS, etc). I think they have some really awesome simulation tools that I have no access to myself.
